The goal of natmanager is to streamline installation of packages from the 
natverse (NeuroAnatomy Toolbox) suite of R packages for computational neuroanatomy. See http://natverse.org/install/ for the full details.

```{r}
install.packages("natmanager")

# install core packages to try out the core natverse
natmanager::install('core')

# Full "batteries included" installation with all packages
# You need a GitHub account and personal access token (PAT) for this
natmanager::install('natverse')
```
